### Aeril
  * Location: The Natural Prison (Frozen Hell)
  * Aarakocra, Male
    * 

## Alexis Gran
  * Location: The Tomorrow Clan's Underground Hideout (Southern Forests of Thrash)
  * Traits: Never without Armor.  Tom-boy-ish.  Wants to accept everyone but is a bit judge-y.
  * Want: To keep Thrash safe. (To stop discrimination when possible.)
  * Fears: Being helpless.
  * Description: Female Caucasian, long red somewhat curly hair, always wears full plate armor, basically sleeps in it.  Not too girly, likes to act strong.  Fights with being a bit judge-y, but really just wants to accept all kinds.  She aims to stop discrimination when possible, but still places the safety of the many above the safety of the few.
  * History: Born and raised in Thrash.  Always wanted to join the Kingdom Guard, but parents kept her from doing so.  The second she got a chance, she made her own wooden armor and her parents were never able to get her to remove it.  She’s upgraded since then.  Despite her dream, she quickly left the Kingdom Guard because she believed that problems could be solved without having to sit around and wait for trouble.  She formed the Fighter’s Guild from that wish after watching a Minotaur (Boron) be picked on when no guards were around.  
  * Notes:
    * Was captured by The Tomorrow Clan after getting caught while looking into Lon Lupus, which was taken by the clan at the time.
    * Was separated from Boron (still at the camp), Snafu, Syrene, McRib (all teleported to the realm of fire and then the southern continent), and Smiff Niblin (Captured and left there), while being captured.
  

## Boron Diborane
  * Location: The Tomorrow Clan's Underground Hideout (Southern Forests of Thrash)
  * Want: To end discrimination. (To bring comfort to the public.)
  * Fears: Other Minotaur. His own reflection.
  * Secret: He'd give anything to no longer be a Minotaur.  
  * Description: A large Minotaur.  Bulky and eccentric, but kind and caring.  Puts the safety of those in need above all else, even if it puts himself in danger to comfort and save others.  Co-founder of the Fighter’s Guild, but aims to have as little responsibility of running the guild as possible, and actually hired Arturo so that he would have to handle less guild management.  With that said, he is a people person and loves to work with other guild members, though he will pull rank if it would be to help someone.  He likes to crack jokes at other people’s expense, but really is just trying to lighten the mood and cover his own feelings.
  * History: Picked on for his frailness at an early age due to a muscle growth problem that causes his muscles to grow at half-speed, Boron was eventually shunned for his uselessness to his people.  This shunning, and the eventual slavery under an abusive Tiefling he had to endure, was so traumatic to Boron, that he grew to fear and hate Minotaur and their culture.  He is constantly haunted by the look of his own face just as much as the look of other Minotaur.

### Ch-tu
  * Location: The Natural Prison (Frozen Hell)
  * Thri-Kreen (Variant), Female
  * Notes:
    * Slowed down from the cold but constantly trying to keep active to keep from freezing.  Ch-tu navigates the perimeter and looks for food and new ways out each hour.  Her pro-active nature has almost made her the defacto leader, and those who work with her are provided for.  However, her strategies are primal as well.  If the week's rations cannot be found, then one of the group is feasted upon.  No exceptions, no arguments.  Being the only one able to create weapons for the group has kept her from losing power, and her skill at hunting and providing helps this, but her real aim is to get out.  One way or another.
    * Tends to listen well, since knowledge is not her strong suit, and someone else's knowledge could improve her chance of survival.
    * Preyed upon a noble while hunting.  Was caught and quickly dropped in the nearby gorge.  Suspected of killing numerous other travelers during her hunts.

### Oskar Brawnanvil @Josh Prichard
  * Class: Beast Master Ranger 3rd Level.
  * Location: New Island (Prison)
  * Family: Pickles (Pet Panther), Unnamed Wife.
  * Home: Not Thrash.
  * Notes:
    * Member of the Fighter's Guild.
    * Brought to New Island in the flash of light that disappeared the Church District in Ryul-Ryal.
    * Quickly captured and imprisoned during the confusion, being split from his panther Pickles.

### Ra
  * Location: The Natural Prison (Frozen Hell)
  * Firenewt Warrior, Female
  * Notes:
    * With the intense cold, Ra slowed to a stop.  Aside from occasional eating, Ra is almost always motionless, whether awake or asleep.  The only reason Ra hasn't frozen to death or starved is because her internal heat is like an ever-burning fire for the other survivors.  The group provides for her in realization that they can't NOT have her heat.
    * Rarely says much and only moves for a few hours each day.  Otherwise, Ra remains still to preserve body heat.  Her main times of help is in emergency situations which require her to come in to the cold for long-distance searches and longer hunting.  She isn't much help with these, but her internal heat helps the group just the same.


## Thrash Veriband
  * Human, Male
  * Activist, King, Revolutionary.
  * Life: 839-914.
  * Thrash was a middle class man born in Fhoran.  Despite his class, his family was the victim of numerous hate crimes that his parents put up with for both their child's sake, and due to no other options being available, as other human countries were never within travel and financial range.  
  * As he came of age, Thrash became a local hero of social rights and fairness.  Becoming an activist in this way, he soon became the voice of many social issues across Fhoran.  With his viewpoint that those who want a better life need to work for it, he encouraged an especially large following from the abused human minority in Fhoran, who almost all stood up to claim the better life themselves.  
  * As tensions in Fhoran rose, his newly-wedded wife, Cassandra, narrowly avoided death at the hand of an amateur assassin.  Enraged and provoked, Thrash publicly denounced the Fhoran leadership, and announced claim over all the mostly untamed lands to the East of the dividing river between Fhoran and New Fhoran for all those who want to claim a better future.  Despite historically regretting his rash speech announcements, he gained an overwhelmingly positive response, and many personal and political friends lead the charge to claim the new land.  
  * Hunted for treason, he was forced to be smuggled out of the country.  Once in the new land, he quickly organized a simple government made up of other activists and personal friends.  After a successful 5-month war to hold the river, Fhoran seemed to back off, despite not accepting the newly named Gemashk as legitimate.  Three years of democracy later, the Gemashk government has started frustrating Veriband with a decided lack of action on important issues, despite their hearts being in the right places.  Well, mostly.  One of the newest members of the government, an infamous Human known as Urrian Panch (a last name that would become synonymous with traitor), was a Fhoran spy who killed off most of the highest government officials in a single night.  Caught in the act by Veriband, Urrian was captured and forced to squeal for his life.  He was allowed to live out his life in a lonely cell, but the damage was done.  Veriband quickly calmed the country with temporary replacements, and was able to predict an internal attack on Ryul, saving hundreds of lives.
  * With Thrash’ continued heroism and leadership over Gemashk, the people overruled his protests to become a sole leader, and rose a people-made vote to enact a royal family to replace the round-table leadership that had failed to work before, quickly following it with an overwhelming vote for the Veriband family to become that royal family.  
  * With little choice, Thrash took up the mantle of King, and was quite happy with the increased control over the kingdom.  In response to the sudden attack from Fhoran, he made the bold call for a counter-attack, gaining unofficial support from nearby countries and mercenary clans to boost chances.  Taken entirely by surprise, Fhoran entirely lost their grasp on the riverfront, and ended up being pushed dozens of miles back past the river before Fhoran accepted defeat to regain most of this extra lost land at the cost of accepting “Thrash’s Kingdom” as a true country.  
  * Fhoran was in a financial crisis at this point after a crippling plague, causing the attack to be very poor timed, and rumor has it that spies in Gemashk found out that the land has very difficult lands to cultivate, and it was not until decades later that the lands would be found as rich in gems.  As such, they surrendered to cut their losses, or so the rumor goes.
  * With the land under control, and popularity at an all time high, King Thrash of Thrash would lead to the discovery of the richest minerals and trade routes in the country, create treaties with neighboring groups and kingdoms, though leaving Fhoran out of most of these treaties.
  * He would die in 914 during a downturn in the Thrash economy that his son, Kishinel 1st**, would be left to deal with in the decades to come.
