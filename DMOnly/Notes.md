## Unimportant Board Members
### U-N1M (U)
  * Created the Unimportants to help other Forged work through their issues, but opened it up to non-Forged over time.
  * The test was originally meant to be a memory-dive assisted by magic, the first (and usually most emotionally painful) of many for a Forged member.  Using similar techniques with the help of some mind-affecting magic and a mind-opening potion, non-Forged can experience much of the same experience, but with harsher and more lasting results in a single vision instead.
  * The masks were originally to hide their forged bodies, but the concept of hiding identity remained the same for non-Forged.
  * Is the only Forged Unimportant that doesn't wear a mask, due to his natural face appearing mask-like.
  * Goals 
      * To find the reason why he and all other Forged exist.  Be that their creator or their creator's purpose for them, he aims to find it and let every Forged decide for themselves what they want to do.
      * Because of a nagging worry that they were not made for nothing, and because of the nagging worry that they were made for nothing, U wants everyone, both Forged and Borne, to control their own lives and make their own decisions.  However, U must accept that any one of them could, at any moment, be called upon by their creator against their will.
      * To help those who lack a home or piece of themselves, like him and the Forged, find their old one, or find or create a new one. 
* Aena Sins'kul
  * The only Borne on the current Unimportant Board, she was controversially brought on to answer the question of "who will stop us if we lose self-control?"  U had worried endlessly over this issue, and refused to have any leadership at all if there was noone to act as a bounds to keep them all under control.
