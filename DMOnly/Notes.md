## Script
### Unimportant Village
* Last we left off, as Kshaya and Eaglor finish up their learning under the Unimportant teachers, you two have come to realize that many of the obilesk reports have stopped, and that the Queen of Thrash has died from sickness.  You near your excellerated graduation day as you prepare for your final challenge; to hunt down and return a missing mask and student with Garuda, making sure to improve the world in doing so.  However, bright and early on the morning of your graduation challenge, you have been oddly summoned to Master U's chambers...
* You find your way up to the hidden entrance to Master U's chambers, only to find Jade walking out of the room as the door closes behind.
  * "Eaglor, Kshaya!  Bright and early, I see!  Excited for your exam?"
  * "Glad to hear it, because it's entirely different from what you've been preparing for."
  * "The King of Thrash has made a call to all capable residents of Thrash to come and lend some extra protection to the castle.  Now, technically this was sent out a week ago but didn't ring any alarms since it makes sense to do so in such a small country and with such a tragic event like the death of a queen.  What's a little more alarming is that we can't teleport there, like, at all.  We don't know when it started, but someone was headed there this morning and we realized that all of OUR magical forms of teleportation fail when aiming at most of Thrash.  Henet's got a confirmed location in Southern Thrash, and we're sending people there now to get to the castle by foot.  Our member at the castle has gone AWOL, or at least hasn't responded since we started contacting her this morning."
  * "Now, walk with me.  I know you two are smart cookies.  Okay, I don't know that, but I'm gonna take a risk and assume that since you're both about to graduate.  Can you two tell me WHY we plan to send you two instead of literally ANYONE else more experienced?"
  * "This is getting cruel, I'll just tell you.  1. You know the king.  2. Convenient Timing.  3. We think we know who your tick-tack-toe doubles partner is.  Fharlangnin is worshiped privately as a god, but not much is known about him.  What I CAN say is that he goes by multiple names, is inconsistently refered to as a god of everything from horizons, to the ethereal, to travel, to games, and has a knack for picking his "favorites" as I'm sure you've realized.  We got the info from another "favorite"'s mind last month before she disappeared.  We were still parsing what that meant, sorry we didn't say so sooner.  However, you probably know what makes all this info relevant right now.  Tell me why?"
  * "Boy, y'all are really making me regret fast-tracking y'all.  The word TRAVEL.  If Fharlangnin is such a god of movement and travel, with or without the Ethereal, then y'all can teleport RIGHT into the castle and find out what's happening with a wink, a nod, and that little wooden snooze-fest you're still carrying around."
  * "When you get there, you make your way to the castle, you find out what's happening, and try and re-establish teleportation within the city.  Here's a Teleport Scroll, it won't be used up until you can fix the problem."
  * "Oh, and, listen.  This is your one and most important task until told otherwise.  I'm not always serious but you'd better not lose focus... Listen, there's a 4th reason you're going, but you're gonna have to trust me when I say that it's a very, VERY good reason."
  * "Okay, was that clear enough?  Any questions?"
  * "No? Okay then.  Well, enough of this dallying, go pick some people randos to br-"
* Having made it out into the courtyard, y'all see Jade entirely unmoving and everything suddenly go quiet as a solid 90% of the other Unimportants around you stop in place.  If it weren't for wind and an occassional student or two gawking as well, then you'd assume that time might have stopped entirely.
  * The closer you look, you realize that their eyes are still moving.  They look pretty frantic before they, like a switch, suddenly glaze over.
  * Suddenly, about half of frozen members rattle momentarily, as their chests uniformly crack or slide open, revealing a shining red light glowing outwardly as all their bodies move into more natural positions.  Their movements are slow deliberate, as they each begin looking around.  
  * Jade slowly looks down and turns to y'all with a level of voice quieted to the sound of mild discomfort, mimicking a lack of intense movement.  "Nevermind.  Wait here, Master U wants to talk to you."
* Looking closer at the chest cavity, you see a series of machinery.  Gears, pistons, and clearly some magic, the detail is shocking and the use of various materials from wood to metal to ceramic to leathers to hide noise and increase longevity in incredible.  At its center is a small round cage with a brightly glowing crystal inside.  Though the closer you look the more you realize that the crystal is actually being lit up from behind.  The crystal seems to be the power source or something to the machine that is Jade.  A construct unlike any other you've ever seen or known.  Jade watches you wordlessly as you examine her insides, but grabs your hand with a firm grip when if attempt to prod inside.
* As you start heading downstairs, you realize that the place is in lockdown.  Youve seen it before but never has it been such a quiet subtle lockdown.  What's going on here?
  * It's about at this time that you feel that a powerful magic is being cast on the vicinity of Unknown's room, as you feel the magic filling the air.
* As you enter Unknown's room, you see long metalic poles making up a bamboo-forest-like dome at the center of the room that bursts out and connects to every wall and angle such that it looks like a seed growing in every direction with a density and multitude of branches such that not much is seeable throughout room.
  * Looking through the poles you see not 1, not 2, but 4 obelisks setup in a square shape.
  * You see the poles swaying vaguely as you try to push through, and they begin blocking your entrance.
  * Looking up, you see what they're attatched to, Unknown, the clan member you knew the least about, has metalic pole-like limbs coming from its back numbering in the hundreds.  Unknown is casting the spell, and right now he controls every one of the poles in this room.  Roll Initiative.
  
* With Unknown gone, a moment passes until you hear one, no 3, no, 9, 13, over 20 explosions and counting as the entire place is shaking and breaking apart.  You both look to the open door and see the end of the hallway caving in coming towards your room.  You both have one action each before the room caves, what would you like to do.

### Castle Town
* You appear in a room.  Walls made of wood and modest furnishings clue you in to it being a house.  A cabin.
* You hear much noise outside, like those of explosions and spells.
* You're in a cabin south of Castle Town just on the edge of a small forest.  You passed this location on the way to Ryul-Ryal, which you never actually visited.
* As you crest the hill, you see the castle town surrounded by hundreds of warriors, trebuchets, spellcasters and more collide on the east and south side of town.  The various mercenaries that the king had called upon facing the overwhelming numbers of the attacking elvan army.  
* The gate, which seems to have been sabotaged early on as only one of the doors is closed while the other is filled with people attempting to get through, some of which seem to be succeeding, while the gate's warriors have chosen not to chase those who make it through or else leave the entrance unfiltered.
* As you approach the town, you feel a sudden weight across your whole body.  You find yourself unable to fly more than 10ft off the ground, pulled down by a strange gravity.  Spells this size and effectiveness must've been cast by a strong magic user, but this one seems like it could be possibly defensive.  
* The town, as you enter, is eerily quiet.  Houses are boarded up, steets and street stands are all but abandoned of non-soldiers, and the only signs of damage appear to be the occasional spell or trebuchet mis-fire that hit some of the eastern houses.  The roads, though, are filled with soldiers fighting with a broad assortment of mercenaries, trying their best to keep them from getting through.  The town has three main roads, as mentioned before, along with battlements along the wall.  The central road is filled with the most combat, and you're sure to get sucked in to it if you went that way.  The eastern side has some fighting, but is mostly on fire and getting hit by stray shots.  The eastern battlements is even worse, but at least has no enemy soldiers up there yet.  The western path is actually pretty quiet from this angle, being furthest from the battle, though it might be a trap set by either side in this situation.  The West battlements is filled with soldiers as well, or at least they should be there, a large section of the wall seems to be missing soldiers altogether from this angle.
* As you approach the northern square, you spot Bonaparte fighting elves with a heavily-armed Minotaur, Xander, and a red-headed valkyrie at his sides, amongst others.  This seems to be a choke point and it shows, with bodies everywhere and a sense that no one is gonna be allowed past there.  Then, it appears...
* As you near the square, catching sight of more people rushing down the hill from the castle, the castle erupts, not from an explosion, but from a summoning.  A strange twisting form forming in front of your eyes at the center of the castle, towering over the castle like a child's toy.  The creature, a pure white, quickly pulls into formation.  A body finishing formation as it knocks the castle over in coming to terms with it's surroundings, before crippling over with it's hands over its ears.  And then it speaks.  "This noise.  This noise!  This realm is so full of noise!  Be quiet, be QUIET!"  Then, it happens...
* Your stomache drops.  The form convulses outward and from it, like an explosion in itself, the colorless ink-blot explosion that still haunts your dreams comes forth from it.  However, it's form is never obscured by it, as if the explosion is see-through but only for the creature.  The wall is coming quickly, and you see the valkyrie and minotaur motioning to those rushing from the castle, a guard leading a regally-dressed child by the hand.  Distantly following is a heavily-armored guard who had just stood up from a dead body.  The King's body.  Bonaparte starts shouting. "Xander, get us out NOW."  Xander doesn't skip a beat and disappears as a portal forms where he once was.
* Y'all catch up to the square at this point as the portal extrudes a large magical fist out, grabbing and yanking people into the portal, first grabbing Bonaparte, then the minotaur, then the woman.  The wall you can see catch up to the heavily-armored guard, whose foot hits the wall, losing a heel and tripping from the pain, getting invelopped like that.
* As y'all make it to the portal and get yanked inside, y'all find yourselves in a large crater, somewhere south of the mountains from what your natural senses can tell.  
* "A visual is shown through the portal from afar, this one is constantly speeding up. 
* "Who else? I can grab 5 more from anywhere."
* You realize that the battlefield isn't going to be where the explosion stops.  This is bigger.  You watch as Ryul Ryal get consumed, the port towns, and such.  You can see the wall from the crater.

### Lon Lupis Remains
* Monsters attack while choices are made on what to do next.
* The monster, Xulvrathox, as the monsters say, approaches, growing bigger as time passes, becoming astronomical size by the time it approaches fully.
* Xander realizes something.  "If this is it, then the cost of a life-taking spell is worth it, no?"
* "Give me time, and I'll return the favor.  Cover me."
* "The portal is ready.  Step through here and you'll be given enough time to fix this, but I can only send 5 total.  Make your pick, and make it fast."

### Epilogue
* You stand in Lon Lupis.  "Extra extra, Spring Festival later this month to be set in the Lon Lupis Mansion after Mayor approves house cleaning and renovation for historial purposes!"




## Unimportant Board Members
### U-N1M (U)
  * Created the Unimportants to help other Forged work through their issues, but opened it up to non-Forged over time.
  * The test was originally meant to be a memory-dive assisted by magic, the first (and usually most emotionally painful) of many for a Forged member.  Using similar techniques with the help of some mind-affecting magic and a mind-opening potion, non-Forged can experience much of the same experience, but with harsher and more lasting results in a single vision instead.
  * The masks were originally to hide their forged bodies, but the concept of hiding identity remained the same for non-Forged.
  * Is the only Forged Unimportant that doesn't wear a mask, due to his natural face appearing mask-like.
  * Goals 
    * To find the reason why he and all other Forged exist.  Be that their creator or their creator's purpose for them, he aims to find it and let every Forged decide for themselves what they want to do.
    * Because of a nagging worry that they were not made for nothing, and because of the nagging worry that they were made for nothing, U wants everyone, both Forged and Borne, to control their own lives and make their own decisions.  However, U must accept that any one of them could, at any moment, be called upon by their creator against their will.
    * To help those who lack a home or piece of themselves, like him and the Forged, find their old one, or find or create a new one. 
  * Fears
    * When a theoretically fatal wound to a Forged's rune that they were able to mend back and save the Forged, U discovered that the runic symbol on every Forged that was thought to bind every Forged to their bodies is immensely magical for an entirely different reason, but identification of the spell is difficult.  He eventually found it to relate to forced control over a forged.  Not for long, perhaps, but long enough where any of the most powerful amonst them could cause devistation.  U is terrified of losing control, and his ultimate goal is to remove this rune from every Forged without causing death.
  * While a great leader, vaguely nieve at times.  Relies on others, especially Unknown, to give him the support he needs to lead.
### Aena (Garuda) Sins'kul
  * The only Borne on the current Unimportant Board, she was controversially brought on to the board in response to the worry of "who will stop us if we lose self-control?"  U had worried endlessly over this issue, and refused to have any leadership at all if there was noone to act as a bounds to keep them all under control.
  * A Monk Cleric Aarakocra, Aena was banished from her home with her daughter, and separated from her son-to-be, after her trust of the plane of water lead to a sneak attack that put the plane of Air on the losing side.  She and her daughter had their wings clipped, their beaks removed, and their back talon cut.  Additionally, though her punishment was officially over, she would be attacked by her people and lose both arms in the process.  
  * She was completely lost in the Material Plane, coming to rely upon her dwindled connection to the gods of water to beg for help.  She would receive some help, becoming a self-trained cleric of the tempest in the short time she could muster, but she and her daughter remained hopelessly poor and in need of assistance.  Up until she and her daughter were found by U attempting to pay for food in Jid Ali, she continually feared for her life.  U found Aena not yet blemished by the selfish nature of residents of the poor district in Jid Ali, only exploited by them, though he had fears about Aena's daughter Quael, he took them in anyway.  With her and her daughter's life literally saved by U, she became as loyal to U as she could be without risking her daughter's safety, joining the Unimportants, and turning her life around.
  * She, in her love of nature, became a druid as part of her training, and decided that while her natural form would remain ruined, she would instead take the form of a Crow as her new natural form.  She remains in this form at all times possible, saving her true form for only the most important tasks or the most intimate times with her daughter.
  * She would choose not to speak to others out of respect for the law of her people, but she would refuse this wish when it came to raising her daughter.  She believes that her daughter was unjustly punished, and punishing her more by stunting her education by silencing the mother was beyond what Aena could respect.  She may write, but her voice is only for her children, who she loves despite their flaws.  
  * Wears a Crow Mask, though it is rarely seen due to remaining in the Crow form for long enough for it not to matter.
### Jade (Jade) Viro
  * The newest member of the Board, replacing the missing Hera, who never returned from a mission to the Plane of Water earlier that month.  In fact, she was instated only a month priar to the party's arrival.
  * She is rough around the edges, but she means well, and her growth is absolutely notable, being a natural at most skills, aside from her surprising non-chelant personality.
  * An Unimportant of action, she is often off in the field helping with any important mission.
### Unknown
  * A researcher at heart, Unknown rarely leaves the depths of the Unimportant vaults.
  * A strategic master, Unknown's tactics are morally questionable, but notably genius.  However, his overwhelming amount of research before a decision is made may guarantee victory, but at the immense cost of time to obtain proof.  
  * Only wears his Black Widow mask in the precense of others, instead showing his multi-eyed robotic gas-mask-like face when amongst his element.
  * Builds multiple attachments to himself, taking full advantage of his form.
  * Never leaves his vaults if possible.
  * Has a direct line into every other Forged if needed.
  * Awoke with U, making U innately trust him.
  * Has told no one that he has this ability, but he can see through the eyes of any Forged within 500ft of him, and can see through any of the masks he makes.
  * Creates the current Masks for the clan.
  * Discovered he and most of the clan's origin, a void dragon named Xaion.  After some time in thought, he realized that it would be best not to reveal this information to his friends and clans members as he found a new goal.
  * While unhappy with existing as a construct at the whim of some other being, he realized and accepted that the path to his freedom from that life for him and his friends was only to come at the success of Xulvrathox, whose plan of reinvention was their only way back to humanity.  
### Henet
  * Mask: Pelican
  * While a lasting member of the board, Pelican is not proven to be the most impressive member of the board.  He is, however, good at keeping things in order.  Pelican handles the organization of the vaults and basement areas.
### Pan
  * Mask: Black Goat
  * Head artisan and head teacher of students within the Unimportants.  Creates the bases of the masks before being inchanted by Unknown.  Has gotten so skilled at transforming with the masks that he can remain in his mixed form for long periods of time and his form is so realistic where skin shows that he doesn't show inconsistencies due to their mechanical nature.

# Final Cruise Group Session
Mauldo the Gearforged Champion

- Icharo (under Xulvrathox)
* 

- Thomas (under Fharlangnan)
* 

- Chodrel Quo (under Xaion)
  * When questioned, he says he made the robot friends and was told to keep creating and spreading them by the voice thar promised him a future where weird him could be accepted.  “I just wanted to make some friends, but all of the real ones were broken.”  He says breaking into tears.  “This crystal helped me build a better friend, telling me I could keep making more as long as I used the friends to charge the crystal obilesk.  It would help me and i would help it to reach its- our goal, to change the nature of human beings en mass.”
  * “Xaion, help me!”
  
- Xaion (under self)
  * As the elevator reaches its peak, rain storming down outside, the crystal begins to glow.
  * Attacking: When you go to attack, a shape moves out and blocks the attack.  
  * Next Turn: You step back as the figure pulls itself from the crystal like steam from a kettle.  It briefly forms around the crystal before lurching at and pulling in the large mecha.  Within moments the figure that forms from this is like a golem of steam, gears, and heat, covered in a glow and mist that is best described as 3D television static.  The glow from this static covers most of the machine's figure, allowing only the most out of place and extreme design aspects to pierce through the cloud.  The figure stands nearly 15ft tall as it stands, gears crunching and steam blowing as the form condenses into a more slender form.  A pair of glowing eyes pierce through the gears and static at the head, while the general shape of a face can be seen.  A dragon, you realize.  The shape it's becoming is draconic, wings and all, as the Dragon melds its personal shape into a Gearforged Void Dragon.
  * "Chodrel, your inability has finally brought a result, so I will let your defensive failings slide.  However, should these "bullies" have their way, our future will soon become theirs."
    * Chodrel: “Y-your form!”
    * “Speak no more, Chodrel.  This is more than enough of me to handle the situation at hand.”
  * The dragon scans his surroundings, stopping once its gaze meets Iuden.  
    * "You're looking well, Iuden.  Have you come to pay your respects?"  
    * "Iuden, do you not recognize your own benefactor?  Perhaps it us unfair to expect recognition in this lesser form."  
    * “This form may not be ideal, but my powers within it are enough.  Join me at my side, Iuden, and your rewards will be even greater.” =Iuden Power=

  * As Iuden goes to attack, make a Charisma Saving Throw at Disadvantage.
  * As the strike hits or attempts to hit, Xaion turns to Iuden: "You poor tragic child, you fail to tell your enemies from your friends.  Perhaps it would be best if you stopped trying."  Xaion uses his reaction to activate the control he has over you, automatically casting the spell that Iuden has studied well.  Make a Wisdom Saving Throw, Iuden.  =Geas=
  * When struck by Iuden: “You poor tragic child, you fail to tell your enemies from your friends.  Perhaps it would be best if you stopped trying.” 
    * Xaion uses his reaction to activate the control he has over you, automatically casting the spell that Iuden has studied well.  Make a Wisdom Saving Throw, Iuden. 
    * “I had no intention of bending you to my will like the Sunset has done to your friends, but perhaps some loss of control will grant you an ounce of respect.”

  * Sees Delvid:
    * "I sense that you too are a follower of the void, Delvid.  You are not one of mine, but I sense that your purpose might be even greater than my own.  We seek the same goal, to protect the pathway between planes; Stand down, and I will grant you the knowledge you seek and divulge all I know about the void and the one that you worship."

  * Sees Morren
    * “Morren, your resistance to the Sunset is admirable.  Though at the cost of it targeting your sister, I doubt that you agree.  You have earned a place at my side should you want it.”

  * Sees Cateline
    * “Poor, poor child.  I doubt you could stop if you wanted to...”
    * “Worry not, your end will come quickly.”

  * Sees Tab
    * "Tab, was it?  Skilled as I'm sure you are, no potion of the mind will help you awaken from your obedience to the Sunset, and no potion of the body will give you the strength to break your shackles, not anymore.  To ask me for help, however, might just free you from your fate.  The Sunset’s control in you runs deep, so you must lose your current form, however, to truly be free." 

  * Sees Mormir 
    * “You have no master, yet you wield great personal strength.  Too much, perhaps.  I predict that your pride will be your downfall, and all you know will go with you.  So no, you do not get an offer of peace, for the only way for you to survive is to beg for your life.  So instead, you will be but a smear once all is done.  And as i predicted,” it turns to Denver. “All that you know will go with you."

  * Sees Scout
    * "A kobold?  Who doesn't run?  How amusing...  Do what your kind is best at, Kobold, and beg for me to be your new master.”
    * “Do not expect your dragon to save you from me.  I have seen your master, and there is no comparison."

  * Sees Nebula
    * “A celestial!?  No, you are but a bastard child of a real threat...”
    * “You confuse me, Nebula, most celestials abhor the void reflexively, perhaps you have some use yet.  Join me, and you will gain powers and knowledge far beyond those you currently possess."

  * Sees Wimble
    * “A pest, lost to the Sunset.  What a waste.  I can guarantee no freedom from you in your current vessel, but in a new one then you might once and for all be free.  Lay down your weapons, if you still can, and you will be given a chance.”
      * A vision of the sunset appears on all horizons and a voice comes to you.  “Listen not to the jealousy of a dragon.  Only together can we survive.  And only together will we be.  Now stand, Wimble, for the Sunset, Fharlanghnin, stands with you.  Will you stand with me?”
      * As you stand, you feel a rush flow through you.  Your wounds close as your health restores to full.  A whispy/strange feeling flows over you and you have a newfound confidence.
      * Faded Form: As a bonus action your form becomes spectral and your body clear.  You have a hover speed of 10ft in this form.  You can move through solid objects.  You stay in this form for 1 minute.  You can deal psychic damage instead when you deal melee damage.  You can become invisible for the extent of your turn as a bonus action.
      * Void Form: As a bonus action your form become voidic and you appear like vivid 3D static.  You can move through spaces as small as 1 inch as rough terrain.  You can stretch your form; your melee attacks have 5ft of extra reach.  Your attacks ignore resistance.  You can change your siloette to any thing medium-sized.


- Wimble
  * 

- Ulfgarf (under god of bloodlust)
  * Pistol appears to be a flintlock piatol but glows violently red and, just for an instant, appears to be covered in blood.  You all snap out of the vision as you hear a loud POW noise as the ranged weapon in Ulfgarf’s hand recoils, blasting through its target with an instantaneous red beam.
  * A voice remains, though unclear.  Your bloodlust must be sated by someone or something.  You instantly know who that target will be.  

  * Blood Blaster
    * 2d8 damage, range (100/260)ft, attunement.
    * Mass Maraud: Once per long rest you can take 1hp from every living creature within 60ft and deal up to 20 of those points to damage a single target, attack rolls are unchanged.
    * Malediction: Once per long rest you can choose to heal yourself up to half of the damage dealt to a target before applying Mass Maraud.



- Delvid (under Xulvrathox)
  * The obelisk calls to him, a message from a precense beyond his immagination calling for him to make sure the obelisk remains in place and unharmed.  The precense you feel doesn’t feel so strongly about the gearmaster.  
  * As if as encouragement, you feel a surge of strength flow through you.  You feel like your connection to nature has become both skewed, and strengthened.  
    * Wildshape of the Void: You can wildshape into a Projection.
  * As you stop to question it momentarily, you feel a tightness in the core of your being, as if something just grabbed a hold of your identity as a paladin and threatens to yank it from your palm. 



- Iuden (under Xaion)
  * Upon seeing the dragon, you, Iuden, feel a burst of energy.  As if your patron has empowered you in this moment.  You gain the following ability.

  * Eldritch Eyes: You can cast Eldritch Blast from your eyes without V, S, or M requirements, and giving you one of the following benefits:
    * Cross Eyed: You can cast Eldritch Blast at two separate targets in a single casting.  Roll both attack dice at once, you choose which roll is to hit which target.
    * Domineye: A target hit by your Eldritch Blast must make a Wisdom Saving Throw against your spell save DC or become Charmed by you until the end of its turn or until shaken out of it by an action spent by another creature.   
  

- Cateline
  * You notice a shape etched into the grime onto the  on his forehead as he pauses and breaks out into a cold sweat.  It was just for a moment, but the shape was distinct: a straight light with a half-circle at the line's center.  As it disappeared, Morren returns to normal.  As your eyes lock on the symbol, they fill your eyes as you become overwhelmed with a warmth like a sunset or sunrise.  You hear, for a moment, a voice, saying that even if you all make it through this, your brother could still die in the aftermath of this crystal, and you won't always be there to help him through it.  Your eyes glaze over, and you turn to the nearby obelisk.  Only it is powerful enough to kill you and Morren; only destroying it can prevent that.  You NEED to destroy it.  Your eyes return as the voice in your head comes to the logical conclusion; no one here is able to use this thing correctly, all the other contenders must be removed from this situation.  You cannot speak of this vision.
  * You feel empowered as your eyes glow brighter:

    * Fade-os Bolt: Your chaos bolt ignores all resistances, doubling the bolt can be aimed at the same target, and if you hit a target with a bolt then you become invisible.
  * if striking Wimble: You turn to Wimble, and the voice in your head stops you.  Wimble is on your side, for now.  You may redirect your attack.
  


- Morren
  * You feel strange as you see and consider the situation with Thomas in front of you.  You feel a similar compulsion, the errant NEED to destroy that crystal, even though you haven't seen it yet.  However, thanks to the roll I had you roll earlier, you recognize and resist this temptation as it starts to leave you.  You realize that you're past the worst of it in this moment once you realize the cold sweat that you've just broken out into, looking around at cateline, who has noticed the issue.  She doesn't speak, but instead breaks into a cold sweat.
  * If Xaion succeeds in probing Morren.  “I see you had a troubling childhood, Morren.  What a shame that you were forced to live as a tool rather than die as a man.”  Casts Phantasmal Force.
  * You see that Cateline is not fully in control, but you see that she has no intention of hurting you instead.  That said, no one takes advantage of your sister, and your emotions start to flare.

  * Stepping into the basement, you notice first a series of chemicals and vials.  They're in their base form, but with some work, you could make them into some powerful stuff.  There are three chemicals here that need to be added in specific orders to make different potions.  A violent chemical, a soothing chemical, and a shifting chemical.  They need to be added in order of importance, and only three doses, including repeats, can be added.  Knowing chemicals, literally anything can be added to the base in small amounts as a dosage, but may not be as powerful as a potion that uses all the chemicals.  There are two of each chemical type.  
  * When you begin walking up the stairs, you feel something grip you.  You know what's up ahead.  Make a wisdom saving throw.  You are gripped by a NEED to destroy the crystal you see as you open the next door.

    * Concoct: You can replicate a spell effect cast within 20ft of you as long as 1 minute ago as a bonus action in a quick concoction taking up two different potions of yours.  You can only replicate an effect once until seen again.  Touch = contact; self = injest.
