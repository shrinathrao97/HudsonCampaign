## Unimportant Board Members
### U-N1M (U)
  * Created the Unimportants to help other Forged work through their issues, but opened it up to non-Forged over time.
  * The test was originally meant to be a memory-dive assisted by magic, the first (and usually most emotionally painful) of many for a Forged member.  Using similar techniques with the help of some mind-affecting magic and a mind-opening potion, non-Forged can experience much of the same experience, but with harsher and more lasting results in a single vision instead.
  * The masks were originally to hide their forged bodies, but the concept of hiding identity remained the same for non-Forged.
  * Is the only Forged Unimportant that doesn't wear a mask, due to his natural face appearing mask-like.
  * Goals 
    * To find the reason why he and all other Forged exist.  Be that their creator or their creator's purpose for them, he aims to find it and let every Forged decide for themselves what they want to do.
    * Because of a nagging worry that they were not made for nothing, and because of the nagging worry that they were made for nothing, U wants everyone, both Forged and Borne, to control their own lives and make their own decisions.  However, U must accept that any one of them could, at any moment, be called upon by their creator against their will.
    * To help those who lack a home or piece of themselves, like him and the Forged, find their old one, or find or create a new one. 
  * Fears
    * When a theoretically fatal wound to a Forged's rune that they were able to mend back and save the Forged, U discovered that the runic symbol on every Forged that was thought to bind every Forged to their bodies is immensely magical for an entirely different reason, but identification of the spell is difficult.  He eventually found it to relate to forced control over a forged.  Not for long, perhaps, but long enough where any of the most powerful amonst them could cause devistation.  U is terrified of losing control, and his ultimate goal is to remove this rune from every Forged without causing death.
  * While a great leader, vaguely nieve at times.  Relies on others, especially Unknown, to give him the support he needs to lead.
### Aena (Garuda) Sins'kul
  * The only Borne on the current Unimportant Board, she was controversially brought on to the board in response to the worry of "who will stop us if we lose self-control?"  U had worried endlessly over this issue, and refused to have any leadership at all if there was noone to act as a bounds to keep them all under control.
  * A Monk Cleric Aarakocra, Aena was banished from her home with her daughter, and separated from her son-to-be, after her trust of the plane of water lead to a sneak attack that put the plane of Air on the losing side.  She and her daughter had their wings clipped, their beaks removed, and their back talon cut.  Additionally, though her punishment was officially over, she would be attacked by her people and lose both arms in the process.  
  * She was completely lost in the Material Plane, coming to rely upon her dwindled connection to the gods of water to beg for help.  She would receive some help, becoming a self-trained cleric of the tempest in the short time she could muster, but she and her daughter remained hopelessly poor and in need of assistance.  Up until she and her daughter were found by U attempting to pay for food in Jid Ali, she continually feared for her life.  U found Aena not yet blemished by the selfish nature of residents of the poor district in Jid Ali, only exploited by them, though he had fears about Aena's daughter Quael, he took them in anyway.  With her and her daughter's life literally saved by U, she became as loyal to U as she could be without risking her daughter's safety, joining the Unimportants, and turning her life around.
  * She, in her love of nature, became a druid as part of her training, and decided that while her natural form would remain ruined, she would instead take the form of a Crow as her new natural form.  She remains in this form at all times possible, saving her true form for only the most important tasks or the most intimate times with her daughter.
  * She would choose not to speak to others out of respect for the law of her people, but she would refuse this wish when it came to raising her daughter.  She believes that her daughter was unjustly punished, and punishing her more by stunting her education by silencing the mother was beyond what Aena could respect.  She may write, but her voice is only for her children, who she loves despite their flaws.  
  * Wears a Crow Mask, though it is rarely seen due to remaining in the Crow form for long enough for it not to matter.
### Jade (Jade) Viro
  * The newest member of the Board, replacing the missing Hera, who never returned from a mission to the Plane of Water earlier that month.  In fact, she was instated only a month priar to the party's arrival.
  * She is rough around the edges, but she means well, and her growth is absolutely notable, being a natural at most skills, aside from her surprising non-chelant personality.
  * An Unimportant of action, she is often off in the field helping with any important mission.
### Unknown
  * A researcher at heart, Unknown rarely leaves the depths of the Unimportant vaults.
  * A strategic master, Unknown's tactics are morally questionable, but notably genius.  However, his overwhelming amount of research before a decision is made may guarantee victory, but at the immense cost of time to obtain proof.  
  * Only wears his Black Widow mask in the precense of others, instead showing his multi-eyed robotic gas-mask-like face when amongst his element.
  * Builds multiple attachments to himself, taking full advantage of his form.
  * Never leaves his vaults if possible.
  * Has a direct line into every other Forged if needed.
  * Awoke with U, making U innately trust him.
  * Has told no one that he has this ability, but he can see through the eyes of any Forged within 500ft of him, and can see through any of the masks he makes.
  * Creates the current Masks for the clan.
### Henet
  * Mask: Pelican
  * While a lasting member of the board, Pelican is not proven to be the most impressive member of the board.  He is, however, good at keeping things in order.  Pelican handles the organization
### Pan
  * Mask: Black Goat
  * Head artisan and head teacher of students within the Unimportants.  Creates the bases of the masks before being inchanted by Unknown.  Has gotten so skilled at transforming with the masks that he can remain in his mixed form for long periods of time and his form is so realistic where skin shows that he doesn't show inconsistencies due to their mechanical nature.
