# Final Cruise Group Session
- Icharo (under Xulvrathox)
  * Icharo turns away from the cage, locking eyes with y’all.  As if in revolt against her unphasable emotionless face is a stream of tears streaking down the side of her face as you see a brief glow of some sort leave her already phantasmal white eyes.  You could’ve sworn that Icharo didn’t have head to toe tattoos last time you saw her, especially the faintly pulsing kind.
  * Icharo, in response, puts a finger up to her tear-soaked lips, pointing at the ceiling, which is wood and has a noticeable creaking to it. 
  * Within moments of your approach, Icharo turns and disappears once again as Icharo turns invisible and begins heading for the door.
  * In one corner of the obelisk room, you see Icharo Maln, the white dragonborn.  She could have fooled you at a glance though, as she now sports intricate shifting tattoos from head to toe, which you now see in full boar due to her only article of clothing remaining being the baggy cloth scraps acting as pants over her thighs.  
  * Icharo’s tattoos begin to swirl and twist along her body, changing color in such a shifting speed that the tattoos appear white and blend into her scales completely.  At this moment you all get the impression that no one touches the obelisk without going through her.  No one.

- Thomas (under Fharlangnan)
  * Prying at the door on the other side of the room is an awakened skeleton; Thomas, to be exact, is yanking and clawing at the large metal doors on the other side of the room, screeching, yelling, and begging to be let in.  
  * DC 10 Arcana : You notice a mark on the underside of his skull that you hadn’t noticed before.  More like an engraving, the mark is a line with a semi-circle at it’s center.  And it’s glowing.  Slightly, but with enough power that you think to check it magically, discovering it’s magical origin.  DC 15 : And its cursed nature.  DC 20 : The mark is absolutely a form of controlling curse.  DC 22 : More accurately meant to deeply compel the cursed to NEED to do something.
  * When pulled from the door, Thomas struggles against your grasp, looking around frantically for another way through.  
  * When questioned, he says that he needs to destroy the crystal.  

- Chodrel Quo (under Xaion)
  * A humanoid who’s a mess at first, and confident when away from a group.  
  * Standing on in the back of the tower by a large machine with a seat on it in the back.  A guard in almost religious full-body armor stands at the room’s center by the load-bearing pilar.  It’s unclear what this guard is, construct or not, but he appears ready to fight, and considering how deep his sword is into the stone floor you’d imagine him to be pretty strong.  
  * He confidently taunts the party and asks what rhey want confidently.  He breaks a bit when he asks how many of his friends the party has killed.  
  * When the party inevitably breaks in, he begins to stutter and fall apart wmotionally as he climbs into his mech/shelter to wait out the battle.  Becoming a mech in an emergency to defend himself.
  * When questioned, he says he made the robot friends and was told to keep creating and spreading them by the voice thar promised him a future where weird him could be accepted.  “I just wanted to make some friends, but all of the real ones were broken.”  He says breaking into tears.  “This crystal helped me build a better friend, telling me I could keep making more as long as I used the friends to charge the crystal obilesk.  It would help me and i would help it to reach its- our goal, to change the nature of human beings en mass.”
  * If able, rushes to the crystal to activate it early.
  * “Crystal, help me!”
  
- Xaion (under self)
  * As the elevator reaches its peak, rain storming down outside, the crystal begins to glow.
  * Attacking: When you go to attack, a shape moves out and blocks the attack.  
  * Next Turn: You step back as the figure pulls itself from the crystal like steam from a kettle.  It briefly forms around the crystal before lurching at and pulling in the large mecha.  Within moments the figure that forms from this is like a golem of steam, gears, and heat, covered in a glow and mist that is best described as 3D television static.  The glow from this static covers most of the machine's figure, allowing only the most out of place and extreme design aspects to pierce through the cloud.  The figure stands nearly 15ft tall as it stands, gears crunching and steam blowing as the form condenses into a more slender form.  A pair of glowing eyes pierce through the gears and static at the head, while the general shape of a face can be seen.  A dragon, you realize.  The shape it's becoming is draconic, wings and all, as the Dragon melds its personal shape into a Gearforged Void Dragon.
  * "Chodrel, your inability has finally brought a result, so I will let your defensive failings slide.  However, should these "bullies" have their way, our future will soon become theirs."
  * "Now, leave in peace, if that is your intent, and you will be spared.  All else must face me."
  * "You're looking well, Iuden.  Have you come to pay your respects?"  "Iuden, do you not recognize your benefactor?"  "Worry not, you soon will.  This form may not be ideal, but my powers within it are enough.  Join me at my side, Iuden, and you will be spared and greatly rewarded with more powers like the ones you feel now."
  * "I sense that you too are a follower of the void, Delvid.  You are not one of mine, but I sense that your purpose might be even greater than my own.  We seek the same goal, to protect the pathway between planes; Stop fighting and I will divulge everything I know about the void and the one that you worship."

- Ulfgarf (under god of bloodlust)
  * Pistol reveal when the bots become overwhelming or for a final strike.
  * Pistol appears to be a flintlock piatol but glows violently red and, just for an instant, appears to be covered in blood.  You all snap out of the vision as you hear a loud POW noise as the ranged weapon in Ulfgarf’s hand recoils, blasting through its target with an instantaneous red beam.
  * A voice remains, though unclear.  Your bloodlust must be sated by someone or something.  You instantly know who that target will be.  
  * Blood Blaster
    * 2d8 damage, range (100/260)ft, attunement.
    * Mass Maraud: Once per long rest you can take 1hp from every living creature within 60ft and deal up to 20 of those points to damage a single target, attack rolls are unchanged.
    * Malediction: Once per long rest you can choose to heal yourself up to half of the damage dealt to a target before applying Mass Maraud.

- Delvid
  * The obelisk calls to him, a message from a precense beyond his immagination calling for him to make sure the obelisk remains in place and unharmed.  The precense you feel doesn’t feel so strongly about the gearmaster.  
  * As if as encouragement, you feel a surge of strength flow through you.  You feel like your connection to nature has become both skewed, and strengthened.  
    * Wildshape of the Void: You can wildshape into a Projection.
  * As you stop to question it momentarily, you feel a tightness in the core of your being, as if something just grabbed a hold of your identity as a paladin and threatens to yank it from your palm. 

- Iuden
  * Upon seeing the dragon, you, Iuden, feel a burst of energy.  As if your patron has empowered you in this moment.  You gain the following ability.
  * Eldritch Eyes: You can cast Eldritch Blast from your eyes, giving you one of the following benefits:
    * Cross Eyes: You can cast Eldritch Blast at two separate targets in a single casting.
    * Domineye: A target hit by your Eldritch Blast must make a Wisdom Saving Throw against your spell save DC or become Charmed by you until the end of its turn or until shaken out of it by an action spent by another creature.   
  * When Xaion says this, you feel a tug as your powers feel like they may slip through your fingers.
  * As Iuden goes to attack, make a Charisma Saving Throw at Disadvantage.
  * As the strike hits or attempts to hit, Xaion turns to Iuden: "You poor tragic child, you fail to tell your enemies from your friends.  Perhaps it would be best if you stopped trying."  Xaion uses his reaction to activate the control he has over you, automatically casting the spell that is Iuden's ultimate goal.  Make a Wisdom Saving Throw, Iuden.
  
- Cateline
  * You notice something glow on his forehead as he pauses and breaks out into a cold sweat.  It was just for a moment, but the shape was distinct: a straight light with a half-circle at the line's center.  As it disappeared, Morren returns to normal.
  
- Morren
  * You feel strange as you see and consider the situation with Thomas in front of you.  You feel a similar compulsion, the errant NEED to destroy that crystal, even though you haven't seen it yet.  However, thanks to the roll I had you roll earlier, you recognize and resist this temptation as it starts to leave you.  You realize that you're past the worst of it in this moment once you realize the cold sweat that you've just broken out into, looking around at cateline, who has noticed the issue.

## Unimportant Board Members
### U-N1M (U)
  * Created the Unimportants to help other Forged work through their issues, but opened it up to non-Forged over time.
  * The test was originally meant to be a memory-dive assisted by magic, the first (and usually most emotionally painful) of many for a Forged member.  Using similar techniques with the help of some mind-affecting magic and a mind-opening potion, non-Forged can experience much of the same experience, but with harsher and more lasting results in a single vision instead.
  * The masks were originally to hide their forged bodies, but the concept of hiding identity remained the same for non-Forged.
  * Is the only Forged Unimportant that doesn't wear a mask, due to his natural face appearing mask-like.
  * Goals 
    * To find the reason why he and all other Forged exist.  Be that their creator or their creator's purpose for them, he aims to find it and let every Forged decide for themselves what they want to do.
    * Because of a nagging worry that they were not made for nothing, and because of the nagging worry that they were made for nothing, U wants everyone, both Forged and Borne, to control their own lives and make their own decisions.  However, U must accept that any one of them could, at any moment, be called upon by their creator against their will.
    * To help those who lack a home or piece of themselves, like him and the Forged, find their old one, or find or create a new one. 
  * Fears
    * When a theoretically fatal wound to a Forged's rune that they were able to mend back and save the Forged, U discovered that the runic symbol on every Forged that was thought to bind every Forged to their bodies is immensely magical for an entirely different reason, but identification of the spell is difficult.  He eventually found it to relate to forced control over a forged.  Not for long, perhaps, but long enough where any of the most powerful amonst them could cause devistation.  U is terrified of losing control, and his ultimate goal is to remove this rune from every Forged without causing death.
  * While a great leader, vaguely nieve at times.  Relies on others, especially Unknown, to give him the support he needs to lead.
### Aena (Garuda) Sins'kul
  * The only Borne on the current Unimportant Board, she was controversially brought on to the board in response to the worry of "who will stop us if we lose self-control?"  U had worried endlessly over this issue, and refused to have any leadership at all if there was noone to act as a bounds to keep them all under control.
  * A Monk Cleric Aarakocra, Aena was banished from her home with her daughter, and separated from her son-to-be, after her trust of the plane of water lead to a sneak attack that put the plane of Air on the losing side.  She and her daughter had their wings clipped, their beaks removed, and their back talon cut.  Additionally, though her punishment was officially over, she would be attacked by her people and lose both arms in the process.  
  * She was completely lost in the Material Plane, coming to rely upon her dwindled connection to the gods of water to beg for help.  She would receive some help, becoming a self-trained cleric of the tempest in the short time she could muster, but she and her daughter remained hopelessly poor and in need of assistance.  Up until she and her daughter were found by U attempting to pay for food in Jid Ali, she continually feared for her life.  U found Aena not yet blemished by the selfish nature of residents of the poor district in Jid Ali, only exploited by them, though he had fears about Aena's daughter Quael, he took them in anyway.  With her and her daughter's life literally saved by U, she became as loyal to U as she could be without risking her daughter's safety, joining the Unimportants, and turning her life around.
  * She, in her love of nature, became a druid as part of her training, and decided that while her natural form would remain ruined, she would instead take the form of a Crow as her new natural form.  She remains in this form at all times possible, saving her true form for only the most important tasks or the most intimate times with her daughter.
  * She would choose not to speak to others out of respect for the law of her people, but she would refuse this wish when it came to raising her daughter.  She believes that her daughter was unjustly punished, and punishing her more by stunting her education by silencing the mother was beyond what Aena could respect.  She may write, but her voice is only for her children, who she loves despite their flaws.  
  * Wears a Crow Mask, though it is rarely seen due to remaining in the Crow form for long enough for it not to matter.
### Jade (Jade) Viro
  * The newest member of the Board, replacing the missing Hera, who never returned from a mission to the Plane of Water earlier that month.  In fact, she was instated only a month priar to the party's arrival.
  * She is rough around the edges, but she means well, and her growth is absolutely notable, being a natural at most skills, aside from her surprising non-chelant personality.
  * An Unimportant of action, she is often off in the field helping with any important mission.
### Unknown
  * A researcher at heart, Unknown rarely leaves the depths of the Unimportant vaults.
  * A strategic master, Unknown's tactics are morally questionable, but notably genius.  However, his overwhelming amount of research before a decision is made may guarantee victory, but at the immense cost of time to obtain proof.  
  * Only wears his Black Widow mask in the precense of others, instead showing his multi-eyed robotic gas-mask-like face when amongst his element.
  * Builds multiple attachments to himself, taking full advantage of his form.
  * Never leaves his vaults if possible.
  * Has a direct line into every other Forged if needed.
  * Awoke with U, making U innately trust him.
  * Has told no one that he has this ability, but he can see through the eyes of any Forged within 500ft of him, and can see through any of the masks he makes.
  * Creates the current Masks for the clan.
### Henet
  * Mask: Pelican
  * While a lasting member of the board, Pelican is not proven to be the most impressive member of the board.  He is, however, good at keeping things in order.  Pelican handles the organization
### Pan
  * Mask: Black Goat
  * Head artisan and head teacher of students within the Unimportants.  Creates the bases of the masks before being inchanted by Unknown.  Has gotten so skilled at transforming with the masks that he can remain in his mixed form for long periods of time and his form is so realistic where skin shows that he doesn't show inconsistencies due to their mechanical nature.
