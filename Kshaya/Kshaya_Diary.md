## Prologue:
I was born in Mythalias. It's a far off country from the entirity of the Thrash-Foren affairs of the world. We are a home to a peaceful peoples and an oppulent society - both in terms of wealth and in terms of knowledge. However, every good story has a dark twist. Mythalias is home to the notorious 'Order of the Fang.' We use political assassination as a way to influence the world and lay our mark for what we believe to be the best. Our valiant mission aside. 

I did not know my parents, they must have passed on when I was a wee child, but the only home I knew was the Order. They recruited me and trained me as the chosen assassin of tradition. The chosen assassin is an assassin that out grows time. Every 100 years, a child similar to me is born and is recruited into the Order, they are regarded as the top trainee in the Order. However as much they wanted me to be an assassin, a blind killer of tradition, my sense of reason and hope that anyone can be reasoned with just outgrew the Order. So while I am still an active member of the Order in good relations, my faith in the assassin's system fell apart a while ago. I believe that blood should not be a means to an end, it should be the very last resort

My only friend, a forbidden friend from the outside, a level headed child-hood slum friend went missing and my reason for leaving became apparent. I would leave to find my friend wherever my Order had hidden him.

## Chapter 1:
This is how I met Eaglor and crew - on my quest searching the most remote corners of the world in search for my friend (granted we only got to the northern islands). It was a couple of days after I actually hired the boat before I actually tried to converse with anyone. Talking with the host was strictly forbidden on diplomatic missions, it was just a precation to help prevent information leak, and of course, the punishment for breaking the rules was as the Fang dictated- usually of the mortal kind. When I was far enough from Fang reach, I decided to meet someone and talk to find out how the rest of the world really was - after all, the insides of the castle can be quite the small world. Eaglor was his name, an Aracocran seagull. Friendly enough chap, he introduced me to the crew and I gave him my Duke of Warlington cover story. I met Dave, the Captain Bonaparte and the bartender, after a nice very artificial evening (and they could tell)we called it a night. After my clinical insomnia took hold of the night, I decided to go on deck to take a look at the ocean, and while I walked to the Captain to make small talk, there was a deep grumble from the ocean... Something so primeval that I, a seasoned traveller- accustomed to facing mortality every day of training felt my knees shake.
