### Possible Combat Based Mechanics

**Ideas from Destiny:**
- Shadow Shot: An ariel bow shot that tethers all enemies within a 10 ft radius. Hitting tethered enemies will either. Both will require balancing to this campaign
	-Regen Health (will compensate for a lack of health in this class)
	-Do Bonus Damage (will further the idea of a glass cannon)

- Shade Step: A reactionary dodge available once per two rounds that will make enemy do a Dex check (will need ratio balance). Loosing the check will get Kshaya to take damage, winning negates damage.

**Ideas from Diablo:**
- Draw from the void: Marking an enemy with a sleight of hand check will place a shadowy mark on the enemy. Damaging this enemy will heal the damager.
- Shadow Roll: A dodge roll (bonus action) that will throw void daggers (thing conjure dagger from skyrim) at up to 2 enemies. The roll travels through the void and comes out 10ft out. Daggers are throw at beggining of the roll. 
	- Maybe warp daggers at a higher level???

**Ideas from WoW:**
- Poisons:
	- Requires furthing of my black-smithing profession and some story with Eaglor/Druid help. This ability takes an action to set up, or can be prepared before a fight, poison stays on the blade for x turns. 

### Possible Non-Comabat Based Mechanics

- **Order Speak:**
	- Need to discuss ASAP, a language that is spoken from the Order to royalty, only known by the two parties mentioned

- **Forge Poison:**
	- Requires furthering for blacksmithing and some knowledge from our fine feathered friend. The ability to scan the environment and make a usuable blade poison out of things

- **Gauge Armory:**
	- Collect em all sort of mechanic for this campaign. Make notes about seen weapons, with great difficulty and time be able to reproduce them.

- **Forge Personality:**
	- A better version of Forge Documents, faster times and with the addition of looking like the copied person
