## Season 4 Notes:
Eaglor and I found ourselves back in the dungeons after we agreed to The Sting and decided to go root out anything suspicious with the current suspects. We rented the cell right opposite the cooks and most of the jailed personell. After a quick scan around, Eaglor found out that the guard just right of our cell was carrying two vials of "assassins blood" poisons which is a very good canidate for the mishaps with the royalty. We decided to mark the guard, but as I also suspected the wine stain on the cook also had traces of the poisons. We also noticed a young dishwasher with muddy stains all over his jeans. Once we finished our analysis Eaglor set his plan into action. He burned the guard's studded leather armor causing his to break his vial, and boy was this guard burned. After avoiding suspicion we waited till morning after a quick switch with who was keeping watch. In the morning, we woke up to guards escorting us outside into an interrogation room. A woman dressed just like Derenal interogated us and asked us about our experience with the Kings meeting and with the jail cell. After a couple of near misses, and a little frustration with the ladies securtiy clearance, we managed to get out while notifying her off the above suspicious character. After being escorted to the old waiting room, a servant showed up with an apology gift - a wand from Xander! We made our way out as free citizens with a mission. I also trusted Eaglor with the mask (I sincerely hope he can learn to control it, otherwise he'll be seeing my blade at his throat).
