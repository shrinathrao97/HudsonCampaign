### Blades
* **Nebulan Blade / Mezurashi:** A thorough study and papers on feel, balance of the blade. Pictures of contstruction etc... The Nebulan blade is made of an interesting material. Seeing tons of weaponry in my life through The Order, I have never seen a weirder material than this. It's forging technique is completely foreign to me and seeing how nebulan magic can actually change the shape and sharpness of the blade, how to quench and reworking the material, its qualities and its properties are foreign to me as well. The material seems to have an odd balancing quality, it cuts through the air with great ease and really anything for that matter. It cut through the nebulans magic stone as though it was butter even though my other well taken care of weaponry could not scratch it. The general construction of the blade is fairly standard for a high quality blade, it is a full tang blade (the knife portion extends into the handle and the ornaments fit on top of the 'tang'). It is white ceramic in color and the handle of the short sword is pitch black masterfully crafted and grafted onto the blade. Whether the blade was shaped magically or forged is beyond me. The material is something I would absolutely love to work with in the future, though as far as I know, it is only found on the now disappeared Islands of the North.



* **Thundering Scimitar +1 / Vajra:** A wonderfully constructed scimitar with an emblazened bluish white jewel in the middle that seems charged with thuderous energy. The blade is full tang and is quite intricate in its etching on the blade. The blade has a full tange and very wide swath meant for slashing rather than piercing. The entire thing seems to be crafted from very high quality carbon steel magically reinforced with Thunder energy.



* **Blink Dagger / Nimisha:** A beautiful dagger that is connected to a silver, etched teleportation ring. The dagger is full tang with black sheath made of an interesting metal and hard leather. It is heavily etched, full tang, sturdy and well shaped. The dagger point allows for heavy piercing damage and the large edges allow for daily use. The smith must have paid particular attention to the balance and distribution of metal material on the blade since the balance of the base blade is near perfect because of the metal weight rings on the handle of the blade, and the hilt itself is perfectly symettrical allowing for a wonderful throwing dagger. 



* **Urthan's Blade:** I have general pictures and drawings, notes on its contruction and diagrams but as for anything enchanting, it's beyond me. However, the blade itself is wonderfully crafted, it is golden at the base and the hild with a scroll on its pommel and it has a blade made out of polished bronze. Activating the swords spell will scan nearby for minds.



* **Snake Fang Dagger x2:** After learning a little from Ansol, I learned that these early protoypes could potentially evolve into a full fledged weapon of destruction. While these current blades aren't tanged properly granting them plenty of structural integrity issues, Ansol did like the way I grafted the actual fang. Post this Ansol said that if I full tanged it, I could use the daggers as injection mechanisms to inject lethal poison.

### Ideas

* **Eaglor Wing Armor:** Eaglor has a 15 wing span, with runic controllable material for eaglor, I could potentially graft armor on eaglors wings to make him a forward facing or rear facing sheild. The risk of course would be that his front / back is exposed but with training, eaglor could protect himself with an armor of runic material. Tl;Dr Wings get armor so he can shield people behind him.

* **Snake Injection Daggers:** Using the snake fang daggers, I should really come up with a more appropriate name, I can hollow the natural bone out where the poison would normally flow to insert my own poison in. A simple pressure based mechanism should suffice (think oak island riddle), would let me inject poison of my choice. I could even inject oxygen into tacticle areas as well to induce bends (think kneecaps and joints), which is what divers et when they come up too faster because there are oxygen/air bubbles building up into their joints that explode whe expanding.
