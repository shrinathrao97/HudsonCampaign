### Blades

* **Nebulin Blade / Mezurashi:** A thorough study and papers on feel, balance of the blade. Pictures of contstruction etc... The Nebulan blade is made of an interesting material. Seeing tons of weaponry in my life through The Order, I have never seen a weirder material than this. It's forging technique is completely foreign to me and seeing how nebulan magic can actually change the shape and sharpness of the blade, how to quench and reworking the material, its qualities and its properties are foreign to me as well. The material seems to have an odd balancing quality, it cuts through the air with great ease and really anything for that matter. It cut through the nebulans magic stone as though it was butter even though my other well taken care of weaponry could not scratch it. The general construction of the blade is fairly standard for a high quality blade, it is a full tang blade (the knife portion extends into the handle and the ornaments fit on top of the 'tang'). It is white ceramic in color and the handle of the short sword is pitch black masterfully crafted and grafted onto the blade. Whether the blade was shaped magically or forged is beyond me. The material is something I would absolutely love to work with in the future, though as far as I know, it is only found on the now disappeared Islands of the North.


* **Thundering Scimitar +1 / Vajra:** A wonderfully constructed scimitar with an emblazened bluish white jewel in the middle that seems charged with thuderous energy. The blade is full tang and is quite intricate in its etching on the blade. The blade has a full tange and very wide swath meant for slashing rather than piercing. The entire thing seems to be crafted from very high quality carbon steel magically reinforced with Thunder energy. The interesting thing about this blade is that it features light little golden marks on the cross guard in the shapes of arcs coming out from the center. Something I would not expect for a typical blade.


* **Blink Dagger / Nimisha:** A beautiful dagger that is connected to a silver, etched teleportation ring. The dagger is full tang with black sheath made of an interesting metal and hard leather. It is heavily etched, full tang, sturdy and well shaped. The dagger point allows for heavy piercing damage and the large edges allow for daily use. The smith must have paid particular attention to the balance and distribution of metal material on the blade since the balance of the base blade is near perfect because of the metal weight rings on the handle of the blade, and the hilt itself is perfectly symettrical allowing for a wonderful throwing dagger. 


* **Urthan's Blade:** I have general pictures and drawings, notes on its contruction and diagrams but as for anything enchanting, it's beyond me. However, the blade itself is wonderfully crafted, it is golden at the base and the hild with a scroll on its pommel and it has a blade made out of polished bronze. Activating the swords spell will scan nearby for minds.


* **Snake Fang Dagger x2:** After learning a little from Ansol, I learned that these early protoypes could potentially evolve into a full fledged weapon of destruction. While these current blades aren't tanged properly granting them plenty of structural integrity issues, Ansol did like the way I grafted the actual fang. Post this Ansol said that if I full tanged it, I could use the daggers as injection mechanisms to inject lethal poison.

* **S.Sword of Memory Stealing / Smarana:** When you roll a 20 with this weapon the target takes extra 2d6 psychic damage. When you get a crit or you kill a target with this weapon you may specify a type of memory through either general description or by asking a question of the target. The player then has a vision with the memory. If the target doesn't have a matching, you witness each other's short term memories extrememly vividly and cannot attack the each other for that turn. Must succeed DC 15 wisdom, or take 2d6 psychic. Also have disadvantage on deception, and intimidation and have advantage on persuation.

* **Farlaghnan's Box:** Squares start blank, can then turn one to circle to cast dimestion door or teleporation circle. From circle to x then can cast teleport then it locks in place. If turn the center to x or o can then cast plane shiftmaterial requirements still exist. Only be used by me.

* **Living Mask, Mamba:**  Requires attunement. Counts as an arcane focus if you wish when worn. Greyish dark, slick looking mask. Although it doesn't stick out and protrude for obvious reasons, it still the predatory nature and features a mamba. The eyes are deep black and are very imposing.  Made with very high craftsmanship. 
  * __Semi Shift:__ You synch with the mask as a bonus action, it lasts for a minute and you can take another bonus action to deactivate it. You start to take on aspects of your creature. Available only once per short rest or long rest. When you shift an immensly satisfying chill runs takes you like relief from a long oppressive heat as your blood runs cold. Your eyes become black with bits of deep browns as you face slightly stretches outward. You feel your form slightly lengthen as your toungue splits and lengthes as well while your nose presses down somewhat. While shifted you gain the following traits:
    * Resistant to poison damage 
    * Advantage on initiative rolls
    * While dashing you move 15ft extra
    * You can use a bonus action to apply to a single weapon or ammunition. The venom lasts for an hour before it wears off. If it hits an enemy/afflicts it the target makes a CON save of DC 8+Proficiency+CON or be under the effects of ray of enfeeblment repeating the save at the end of its turns. If you strike a enfeebled target with venom them must make another CON save or be poisoned. If you strike a poisoned target with venom, then they make the same check or become stunned for one round and loose all venom effects. 

* **Living Mask, Spark:** Requires attunement. Counts as an arcane focus if you wish when worn. A shifting orb like mask with magical faces coming and going as they please. Ever transforming and odd and unshapen. 
  * User now knows the cantrip shocking grasp. When you come withing 30ft of a creature that has died within last one minute, Mask draws in the last soul remenant of the drifting creature, make a charsima saving throw with DC on creatures challenge rating or level, or it's 10+CR if creature resists. On success the mask collects the unconcious remenant, amount of remenants has it's limits. 
  * __Semi Shift:__ You synch with the mask as a bonus action, it lasts for a minute and you can take another bonus action to deactivate it. You start to take on aspects of your creature. Available only once per short rest or long rest. In this form, your mask seals over your face as your form glistens with other worldly shimmering, your physcial form remains unchanged but is viusually emminating a silvery purple smoke or steam. While in this form you have the following aspects:
    * You become resistant to lightning damage
    * You have a flying hover speed of 5ft minimum
    * Shocking Graps deals extra damage equal to your current remanent count

### Ideas

* **Eaglor Wing Armor:** Eaglor has a 15 wing span, with runic controllable material for eaglor, I could potentially graft armor on eaglors wings to make him a forward facing or rear facing sheild. The risk of course would be that his front / back is exposed but with training, eaglor could protect himself with an armor of runic material. TL;DR Wings get armor so he can shield people behind him.

* **Snake Injection Daggers:** Using the snake fang daggers, I should really come up with a more appropriate name, I can hollow the natural bone out where the poison would normally flow to insert my own poison in. A simple pressure based mechanism should suffice (think oak island riddle), would let me inject poison of my choice. I could even inject oxygen into tacticle areas as well to induce bends (think kneecaps and joints), which is what divers experience when they come up too faster because there are oxygen/air bubbles building up into their joints that explode when expanding.

* **Ethereal Short Sword:** Well now that Kshaya knows that his phasing in and out of reality was really him moving into and out of the border ethereal, how are different materials affected to the border ethereal? How does weaponry affected to 

* **Cape of the Wind Cutter:** A modifed Cape of Billowing that flutters daggers on the spell, the uneven fluttering can be cued to shoot daggers behind a player. Alternatively, based on the application of removal of centripetal force, daggers can eject and slice and retract.

* **Arrow of White Metal:** A modified arrow where the arrow sits inside of a rifled barrel casing. Casting heat metal will explode the arrow head and send it flying further and faster- can act like a long range missile. (Not mentioning the white hot arrow that is going to impale the enemy)

### Techniques
* **Ansol's Veff Indents:** Ansol used his shoulders and his entire body weight to push a hammer into the edge of a blade rather than smacking it into the edge making perfect periodic indents creating a wave like patter on the blade. This not only helps with the peircing and slashing potential due to the ripping nature of thick-shallow edges but also gives the blade a very premium and sharp look. 

* **Layer Forging:** An untested technique that allows the layering of metals on a single blade. This technique more focuses on creating the ingot that might be hammered into the blade rather than the actual pointed/sharp object itself. Thing of blowing bubbles. The first layer (the core) is made thin by dipping a thin frame into a vat of molten metal. The metal sticks the fram much like a bubble blower. Conitunue this process until the desired ingot is achieved. Alternatively you could make an ingot layered with different materials. This allows the blade to be hard and soft (depending on where the materials are) or have different properties from inside to outside). Sharpening them/exposing different layers could have different effects in combat. Remember to start with hard/high boiling point metals and move down the scale so as to not destroy the previous layer. Speed, efficiency of movement and timing might be key.

### Ethereal Tests: Material Science Tests!
* **Leather Armor:** ?
* **Ball Bearing:** Normal
* **Medallion:** Normal
* **Mezurashi:** Seemed like the odd sense of gravity didn't affect it, I need to explore!
* **Smarana:** ?

### Other
* **Farlagnan's Box** A box given to Kshaya by Farlagnan after the events of the Unimportant trial. The box enhances Kshaya's inherent capabilities to let him use much higher tier spells. He has 8 uses of Dimension Door or Teleportaion Circle or Teleport. The middle both times is plane shift.
